Gengo.js
=======

 An uber basic and simple i18n library for Express 4

This is the official repo for [Gengo.js](http://www.gengojs.com) site. If you would like to improve this site by adding locales (since as you may know, I don't have the brain to store x amount of languages) and also changing the supported languages as you add locales, then you are free to fork and improve this site.

I do plan to add tests along the way, but I am not a guru with testings so if something is wrong in the way I created tests, then feel free to suggest the most optimal way to test the languages and this site.
